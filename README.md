# Grappppling Hook Gun

## Description

In this project, I create a grappling hook gun. The player is able to left-click and deploy the grappling hook and swing around until disengaging using the right-click. The grappling hook slowly moves the player in the direction of where the grappling hook landed. Made using raylib and C++.
